### Sprint 1 Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `pnpm install` succeeds on a fresh clone
- [x] `pnpm mock-api:dev` starts Fastify at port 4000
- [x] `curl http://localhost:4000/v1/rate-items` returns 12 ₹-priced items
- [x] App entry point routes to auth or onboarding based on user state
- [x] Typing any email/password signs in via mock API
- [x] New user flows through 3-step onboarding and lands on Designs list
- [x] Token persisted in SecureStore; app reopens to signed-in state
- [ ] App boots on `emulator-5554` — requires `logo.svg` in `assets/brand/` and `pnpm brand:generate`

## Sprint 2 — Canvas Harness + Floor Manager (Weeks 3–4)

**Goal:** Draw and move rooms on a 2D canvas with pinch-zoom, snap-to-grid, floor tabs.

**Status:** 🔄 In Progress (2/3 tasks done)

| Task ID | Title | Status | Story Points |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| TASK-2001 | Skia canvas harness — pan, pinch-zoom, snap-to-grid, ruler | ✅ Done | 13 |
| TASK-2002 | Floor manager — add/remove/reorder floors, tabs | ✅ Done | 5 |
| TASK-2003 | Room primitive — draw, resize, room-type picker, collision | ⬜ Pending | 8 |

**Sprint 2 total:** 26 pts (13 done, 13 remaining)

### TASK-2001 Deliverables
- `src/canvas/` — types, constants, viewport transform math (pure TS, fully unit-tested)
- `useViewport` — Reanimated shared values for `tx`/`ty`/`scale`; simultaneous `Gesture.Pan + Gesture.Pinch` with focal-point zoom; `zoomToFit` helper
- `GridLayer` — Skia path-based grid built on the UI thread via `useDerivedValue`; 3 density levels (10 ft major / 1 ft minor / 6 in snap) that appear/disappear by zoom scale
- `RulerOverlay` — H+V rulers with tick paths (UI thread) and foot labels (JS thread via `useAnimatedReaction`)
- `CanvasView` — `GestureDetector` wrapping `Canvas`; content inside viewport `Group transform`; ruler rendered in screen space above content
- `usePerfHarness` — `useFrameCallback` rolling 60-frame FPS window; `formatPerfReport` outputs CI-ready JSON
- `app/(app)/canvas/[designId].tsx` — canvas screen; 100-room stress-test demo; ⏱ button records + displays perf report
- `jest.canvas.config.js` + `babel.canvas.config.js` — isolated node-env Jest config for pure math tests
- CI: `Canvas unit tests` step + `Upload perf report artifact` step added to mobile job
- **20/20 unit tests passing** (canvasToScreen, screenToCanvas, visibleRect, snapToGrid, snapPointToGrid, zoomAtFocalPoint, clampScale, firstGridLine)

## Frontend-First Exit Criteria

On an Android emulator you can:
1. Sign up with any email/password
2. Complete the 3-step onboarding (archetype, location, optional details)
3. See an empty Designs list ✅
4. _(Sprint 2)_ Draw a 2-floor 4-room design
5. _(Sprint 2)_ Save it to the mock API
6. _(Sprint 4)_ Tap "Estimate" and see a ₹-denominated breakdown
7. _(Sprint 4)_ Export a stub PDF to device storage

Once Sprint 4 is complete → ready for real-backend Sprint 1.
